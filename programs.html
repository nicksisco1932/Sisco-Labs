        <section>
            <h2>Reset & Prime – 3 Weeks</h2>
            <p>This foundational phase recalibrates biological rhythms and prepares your body for sustainable transformation. You will stabilize sleep patterns, reframe energy intake, and reestablish metabolic awareness — creating a platform for real progress without burnout or confusion.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adaptive Physiology 101: Understand why fat loss plateaus happen</li>
                <li>Structured meal patterns and protein optimization</li>
                <li>Baseline physical activity tracking and recovery awareness</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Recomp & Resilience – 6 Weeks</h2>
            <p>This progressive phase focuses on improving body composition, increasing muscular strength, and building metabolic resilience. Strategic training, fueling, and recovery practices ensure that your adaptations are durable and enhance both aesthetic and performance outcomes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strength training progression and tracking (RPE, load, volume)</li>
                <li>Active recovery integration (CNS, hormonal, musculoskeletal)</li>
                <li>Strategic pre- and post-exercise nutrient timing</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Performance & Autonomy – 12 Weeks</h2>
            <p>The final phase is about mastering your system. You will develop adaptive training cycles, implement intelligent recovery strategies, and gain autonomy over your physiology. This is not just about achieving fitness goals — it's about sustaining resilience for life.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Periodized training and recovery planning</li>
                <li>Metabolic flexibility through intelligent nutrient cycling</li>
                <li>Self-regulation systems: readiness monitoring, autoregulation, lifestyle periodization</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <p><strong>Each program is a scientific system engineered for real transformation — not temporary results.</strong></p>
