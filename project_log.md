# Sisco Labs Website Launch Log

## Phase 1: Initial Situation
- Scientific fitness business website partially operational.
- Issues:
  - Mobile menu (hamburger icon) non-functional.
  - Merge conflict artifacts corrupting HTML.
  - Layout and button style inconsistencies.
- Primary goal: Achieve clean, professional MVP-quality deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Phase 2: Strategy Adjustment
- Tested hamburger mobile menu fixes.
- Decided to simplify:
  - Reverted to a **static navigation bar** (no hamburger button).
  - Horizontal nav links centered under title.
  - Links stack neatly on mobile.

## Phase 3: Core Fixes

- CSS rebuilt:
  - Top title centered.
  - Nav links centered horizontally.
