            <h1>Welcome to Sisco Labs</h1>

            <p><strong>Resilience is built, not given.</strong></p>

            <p>At Sisco Labs, we believe fitness is more than appearance — it is an evolving biological system rooted in adaptation, resilience, and autonomy. Our programs are built on scientific foundations, empowering you not just to train harder, but to train smarter — for life.</p>

            <p>Through a structured 12-week curriculum — Reset, Recomp, and Performance — you will learn to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Master adaptive physiology and break plateaus intelligently</li>
                <li>Rebuild your metabolic resilience through strategic training and fueling</li>
                <li>Develop lasting strength, energy, and autonomy beyond aesthetics</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This isn't just another workout plan. It's a biological education for your future self.</p>

            <p><strong>Ready to reclaim your physiology?</strong></p>

                <li>You are committed to sustainable strength and metabolic resilience.</li>
                <li>You want to take ownership of your adaptation — not outsource it.</li>

        <section class="philosophy">
            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>At Sisco Labs, we recognize that fitness is an evolving biological system — not a static achievement.  
            We guide individuals to engineer their own adaptation intelligently, bridging the latest physiological science with the timeless principles of resilience, discipline, and autonomy.  
            Our mission is simple: equip you to become your own system architect — for life.</p>
