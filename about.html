            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>At Sisco Labs, we believe fitness is not an endpoint — it is a lifelong adaptive system. True strength is built through resilience, guided by science, and sustained by deliberate, intelligent practice. We reject shortcuts, trends, and hollow promises. Instead, we offer a framework grounded in biological reality and designed for sustainable personal growth.</p>

            <h2>About Nicholas J. Sisco, Ph.D.</h2>
            <p>Founder of Sisco Labs, Dr. Nicholas J. Sisco holds a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, a bachelor's degree in Nutrition Science, and completed postdoctoral fellowships in Neuroscience and MRI Imaging. His academic journey built a deep understanding of human physiology, adaptive stress systems, and metabolic resilience — knowledge that forms the core of Sisco Labs’ programs.</p>
            
            <p>Before academia, Dr. Sisco served in the United States Marine Corps, an experience that forged a lifelong commitment to discipline, functional strength, and mental resilience. His unique background bridges scientific rigor with lived experience, allowing him to create fitness and nutrition systems that are not just effective, but transformational.</p>
