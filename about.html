            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>At Sisco Labs, we blend scientific research, experiential knowledge, and creative problem-solving to empower clients toward sustainable growth.  
            Fitness is not just a goal — it is a dynamic biological system, evolving in response to structured challenges and recovery.</p>

            <p>We reject fleeting trends and pseudoscience in favor of enduring, proven methods rooted in adaptive physiology, neuroscience, and metabolism.  
            Our mission is to give individuals the tools, education, and systems to engineer their own resilience — physically and mentally.</p>

            <p>Our approach is driven by a simple principle:  
            <strong>Resilience is built, not given.</strong></p>
