            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>At Sisco Labs, we blend scientific research, experiential knowledge, and creative problem-solving to empower clients toward sustainable growth.  
            Fitness is not just a goal — it is a dynamic biological system, evolving in response to structured challenges and recovery.</p>

            <p>We reject fleeting trends and pseudoscience in favor of enduring, proven methods rooted in adaptive physiology, neuroscience, and metabolism.  
            Our mission is to give individuals the tools, education, and systems to engineer their own resilience — physically and mentally.</p>

            <p>Our approach is driven by a simple principle:  
            <strong>Resilience is built, not given.</strong></p>
			
			<p>My name is Nicholas J. Sisco, Ph.D.—founder, creator, and the mind behind Sisco Labs. I’m a Ph.D. biochemist, Marine Corps veteran, and systems architect deeply focused on how humans adapt—biologically, cognitively, and physically.</p>
			<p>My scientific training began under mentors who were themselves trained by Nobel laureates. I was fortunate to contribute to research that became part of a Nobel-winning discovery in 2021. That level of rigor defines everything I do—from MRI signal modeling in my research career to analyzing movement, metabolism, and recovery for clients at Sisco Labs.</p>
			<p>My journey into fitness and nutrition began in high school, the moment I took a week-long physiology elective—I couldn’t stop thinking about it. As a freshman, I played varsity football, baseball, basketball, and ran track. I briefly played collegiate baseball before life changed course. In 2005, I joined the United States Marine Corps and continued my passion for fitness while serving. After leaving the military in 2009, I returned to school and earned my degree in nutrition science, with minors in biochemistry and chemistry.</p>
			<p>During undergrad, I was active in the pre-medical community and taught anatomy, including human cadaver dissection and study section leadership. I later earned my Ph.D. at Arizona State University, where I studied biochemistry with a focus on physics and chemistry applied to biological systems. I completed two postdoctoral fellowships to refine the skills needed to become an NIH-funded principal investigator. But in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic upended that trajectory—elective medical research halted, funding dried up, and I pivoted.</p>
			<p>That pivot led me to Profound Medical, where I’ve worked at the forefront of prostate cancer treatment using a novel device platform. It wasn't the original dream, but the role reminded me of my deeper passion: helping others take control of their bodies through fitness, nutrition, and applied science.</p>
			<p>I believe one of the few things we can control is what we put into our bodies and how we choose to move them. Through fitness and nutrition, we reclaim agency. We regain freedom.</p>
			<p>At Sisco Labs, I’ve combined my scientific expertise with decades of real-world training to build performance pipelines, write high-level code for tissue modeling, and develop adaptive systems that evolve with your biology—not against it.</p>
			<p>This isn’t about hacks or willpower. It’s about precision, feedback, and sustainable transformation.</p>
			<p>Your body is a system. It deserves to be treated like one.</p>
			<p>Welcome to Sisco Labs. This isn’t generic coaching. It’s engineered evolution.</p>
